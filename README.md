# `nixfmt`

`nixfmt` is a formatter for Nix code, intended to easily apply a uniform style.
This is a work in progress.

## Build & Installation

This project can be built with nix. `nix-build https://github.com/serokell/nixfmt/archive/master.tar.gz`, `nix-env -iAf https://github.com/serokell/nixfmt/archive/master.tar.gz`.

## Development

First, enter `nix-shell`, then run `cabal v1-build` to build, `cabal v1-run` to
run and `cabal v1-repl` for a REPL.

## Usage

Run `nix-build` in the root of the project. The binary can then be called with
`result/bin/nixfmt`. It reads nix code from stdin and writes a formatted version
to stdout. Invoking the binary with an argument file will cause the file to be
formatted in place.

## For Contributors

We welcome issues and pull requests on Github.
