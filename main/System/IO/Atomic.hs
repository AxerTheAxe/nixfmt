-- | Atomic file IO.
--
-- This modules allows one to replace the contents of a file atomically by
-- leveraging the atomicity of the @rename@ operation.
--
-- This module is a crossover of the `atomic-write` and `safeio` libraries
-- with the fs-related behaviour of the first and interface of the second.
module System.IO.Atomic
  ( withOutputFile
  ) where

import Control.Exception (bracketOnError)
import Control.Monad (when)
import System.Directory (doesFileExist, removeFile, renameFile)
import System.FilePath (takeDirectory, takeFileName)
import System.IO (Handle, hClose, openTempFileWithDefaultPermissions)
import System.Posix.Files (fileMode, getFileStatus, setFileMode)


-- | Like @withFile@ but replaces the contents atomically.
--
-- This function allocates a temporary file and provides its handle to the
-- IO action. After the action finishes, it /atomically/ replaces the original
-- target file with the temporary one. If the action fails with an exception,
-- the temporary file is cleaned up.
--
-- Since the procedure involves creation of an entirely new file, preserving
-- the attributes is a challenge. This function tries its best, but currently
-- it is Unix-specific and there is definitely room for improvement even on Unix.
