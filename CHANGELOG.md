# Revision history for nixfmt

## 0.1.0 -- 2019-05-11

* The first released version of nixfmt. This project aims to provide a
  consistent formatter for Nix code. This release is capable of parsing all of
  nixpkgs and formatting it in a consistent way. The generated code is not yet
  pretty in all places though and there are still some other issues as well.
